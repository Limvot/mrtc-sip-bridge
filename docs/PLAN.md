# Implementation plan

Status: **Phases 0-3 and J implemented and validated live; Phase 4 (robustness) next.** Read `DECISIONS.md` (why) and `RESEARCH.md` (facts and sources)
first. Update the checkboxes and the "Current state" section as work lands, so the next agent can pick up.

## Current state

- Phase 0 (spikes), Phase 1 (skeleton), Phase 2 (inbound calls), Phase 3 (outbound calls, DTMF) and
  Phase J (embedding in mautrix-jabber) are implemented and were validated against a live JMP account
  and a Synapse/LiveKit deployment: inbound and outbound calls, DTMF, decline and ring-out, and
  hang-up from either side all work. Phase J also works in shared Cheogram rooms.
- Key decisions from the spikes: production pre-joins LiveKit while ringing. Ring `lifetime` = ring
  timeout. Pin the registrar to one resolved IP. Unregister only our own Contact.
- Element X is affected by an upstream Element Call pickup bug for outbound calls; use `!sip call`
  there. Sable and other clients can press the call button in a number's room.
- The jabber-side embedding lives on a `local/sip-calls` branch of mautrix-jabber that is not published.
- Next: Phase 4 (robustness).

## Goal

A SIP phone account (first target: JMP.chat SIP credentials) becomes Matrix calls where:

- **Inbound:** a call to the number rings **every Matrix client** of the owner (Element X, Element Web,
  Element Call) through MatrixRTC/LiveKit. Answering on any client connects audio, and the others stop
  ringing.
- **Outbound:** starting a call in a room for a number, or using `call <number>`, places a SIP call from
  the account.
- Each call leaves a timeline notice (missed / answered / outgoing + duration).
- **Optionally** (mautrix-jabber embedded mode): calls ring in the *same room* as that number's Cheogram
  texts.

Out of scope: legacy `m.call.*`, encrypted rooms, video, SMS/MESSAGE.

## Architecture

The call core is a library. Two "hosts" supply rooms and ghosts (ADR-006).

### Inbound call flow (target)

1. INVITE arrives on the registered contact. Reply `100 Trying`.
2. Caller number → E.164 → `host.ResolveCallRoom` (standalone: own portal; embedded: Cheogram portal).
3. Reply `180 Ringing`. The ghost sends `call.member` and then the MSC4075 `ring` notification.
   Every owner client rings.
4. Watch the room for the owner's `call.member`:
   - Owner joins → ghost joins LiveKit (OpenID → lk-jwt-service token), send `200 OK` with a PCMU/PCMA
     SDP answer, pipe media both ways.
   - MSC4310 decline / ring timeout → `603 Decline` / `480`. Notice: "Missed call" / "Declined".
   - Caller CANCEL → clear the ghost membership. Notice: "Missed call".
5. Teardown either way: SIP BYE ⇄ owner leaves (membership cleared or expired). Leave LiveKit, clear
   membership, post a notice with the duration.

### Outbound call flow (target)

1. Owner starts a call in a number's room (their `call.member` appears with no active call), or runs
   `call <number>`.
2. Ghost joins LiveKit, INVITE (digest auth) to the provider. Ringback: relay 183 early media, or play
   a generated tone.
3. 200 OK → ACK, media flows. Failure → notice with the SIP reason, ghost leaves.

## Roadmap

Each phase ends with something working and testable. Tick boxes as they're done.

### Phase 0 — Spikes (de-risk before structuring the code)

Throwaway code under `spikes/`. Write findings back into RESEARCH.md.

- [x] **S1 MatrixRTC ringing from an appservice ghost.** Ghost in an unencrypted room with the owner
      publishes `call.member` and the MSC4075 ring. Confirm Element X and Element Web ring. Get an
      OpenID token as the ghost, exchange it at lk-jwt-service, join LiveKit with server-sdk-go,
      publish a looping tone. Owner answers and hears it. *Find out:* exact event types, content and
      state keys (take them from the MSCs and check against current Element Call and lhns
      `pkg/calls`), membership expiry, how clients stop ringing.
- [x] **S2 SIP UA against the real JMP account.** sipgo: REGISTER with digest auth, receive INVITE,
      answer PCMU, record inbound RTP, send a tone back, place one outbound call. *Find out:* the
      current registrar host/port, NAT needs on the deployment host, codecs offered, re-register
      interval, whether `diago` is worth adopting (MPL-2.0, fine for us).
- [x] **S3 bridgev2 event hook.** How a bridgev2 connector receives `org.matrix.msc3401.call.member`
      and the MSC4310 decline. Needed by **both** hosts, so write it up so mautrix-jabber can reuse it.

Exit: S1 + S2 demonstrated. If media/NAT looks bad, re-open ADR-003.

### Phase 1 — Core library skeleton + standalone host

- [x] Go module `github.com/williamkray/mrtc-sip-bridge`, same mautrix version line as mautrix-jabber.
- [x] Define `CallHost`, `CallRoom`, `GhostIntent`, `LoginRef` in `pkg/` (ADR-006 sketch). Core
      packages import only `id`/`event` from mautrix plus these interfaces. Add a lint/test check that
      `pkg/{sipua,media,rtc,matrixrtc,calls}` never import `pkg/connector`.
- [x] Standalone host: `cmd/mrtc-sip-bridge` (bridgev2 `mxmain`), `pkg/connector` with a login flow
      (SIP username, password, registrar host:port, transport, display number), portals per E.164,
      ghosts per number.
- [x] Config: RTP port range, external IP, lk-jwt-service URL override (otherwise discover via the
      homeserver's RTC transports), ring timeout, default country code.
- [x] Phone normalisation (reimplement from mautrix-jabber `pkg/connector/cheogram.go`; same author).
- [x] Dockerfile/build.sh like mautrix-jabber (cgo + libopus). Publish the RTP UDP range.
- [x] REGISTER keep-alive with backoff. Bridge state reporting.
- [x] **T6 telemetry foundation**, per `docs/TELEMETRY-SPEC.md` §8.1: `pkg/obs` (core,
      OTel API only) and `pkg/telemetry` (host, SDK), import-boundary check, Phase 1 instrumentation
      (bridge start, login/connect/disconnect, SIP registration, MatrixRTC event ingest, bot commands,
      outbound Matrix HTTP) and metrics, and docs (README "Tracing and metrics", CLAUDE.md, CREDITS).
      Sub-tasks T6a..T6e, then an Opus review. Telemetry is part of every later phase's definition of
      done (below).
- [x] Live test against JMP + dev Synapse (needs the bridge reachable from Synapse).

### Phase 2 — Inbound calls MVP (standalone)

- [x] `calls/` inbound state machine. One active call per login at first.
- [x] `matrixrtc/`: membership publish/clear, ring, owner-membership watch, decline, ring timeout
      (default 30 s).
- [x] `rtc/`: token fetch, LiveKit join/leave, publish Opus from SIP audio, subscribe to the owner's
      track → PCMU.
- [x] `media/`: RTP send/receive, jitter buffer, resampling, silence fill.
- [x] Rooms are created unencrypted. If a room turns out to be encrypted, post a notice and log an
      error instead of producing a silent call.
- [x] Timeline notices.
- [x] Ring hygiene (from S1): pre-join LiveKit while ringing. Ring `lifetime` = ring timeout (~30 s).
      On answer, send a read receipt for the ring as the owner (double puppet) so push-driven clients
      (Sable Android) dismiss the ring. On CANCEL/timeout, clear membership **and** redact the ring.
- [x] Manual test: call the JMP number from a mobile, answer in Element X, 2+ minutes of two-way audio,
      hang up from each side.
- [x] **Telemetry (TELEMETRY-SPEC §8.2):** spans of §5.6 and §5.10 (`call.inbound`, `call.ring`,
      `call.answer`, `rtc.*`, `matrixrtc.membership.*`, `matrixrtc.ring.*`, `media.start/stop`,
      `call.teardown`, `call.session`, `call.notice.send`); call, rtc and media metrics of §4.3;
      `call_id` log field; lk-jwt-service client wrapped; hot-path rule (§4.2) with a benchmark showing
      zero allocations per RTP packet from telemetry; state-machine tests assert the trace shape with
      fake SIP/RTC/host, including CANCEL, decline, timeout and answer branches, and that the setup span
      ends at ACK.

### Phase 3 — Outbound calls (standalone)

- [x] Owner-initiated call detection, `call <number>` command, `ResolveIdentifier`.
- [x] INVITE with digest auth, early media / ringback, failure notices.
- [x] DTMF out (RFC 4733) through a room command while a call is active (for IVRs).
- [x] Manual live test of `docs/PHASE3-SPEC.md` §12.2 (outbound from Element X/Sable, `!sip call`, DTMF,
      failure notices).
- [x] **Telemetry (TELEMETRY-SPEC §8.2):** §5.7 and §5.8 (`cmd.call`, `cmd.dtmf`, `cmd.hangup` through
      `withSpan`), `sip.invite` with auth-challenge event, `call.ringback`, `mrtcsip.dtmf.sent`; a test
      proves DTMF digits never reach spans or logs.

### Phase J — mautrix-jabber embedded mode (unified rooms)

`[~]` = implemented on `phasej-embedding` / `local/sip-calls`, in progress until the live test (PHASEJ-SPEC §12).

Starts once Phases 2–3 work standalone. Work happens mostly in `../mautrix-jabber`, on a feature branch
there.

- [x] **J1 API freeze-lite:** tag `v0.x` of the core library (optional: jabber uses a local `replace`, PHASEJ-SPEC D2). Write a short `docs/EMBEDDING.md` here
      covering what a host has to implement, how to feed it MatrixRTC events, and lifecycle
      (start/stop per login).
- [x] **J2 jabber config + creds:** `network.calls.enabled` (default false) in `JabberConfig`.
      SIP credentials in `JabberLoginMeta` (registrar, username, password), set with a new bot command
      (`!jabber sip-login` / `sip-logout`). Calls start for a login only when both the flag and creds
      are present.
- [x] **J3 jabber CallHost:** `ResolveCallRoom` maps E.164 → Cheogram JID (`+1555…@<cheogram
      domain>`) → existing portal key, creating the portal like `ResolveIdentifier` does. Ghost = the
      Cheogram ghost. `SendCallNotice` goes through the portal. Owner = the login's Matrix user.
- [x] **J4 event plumbing:** reuse the S3 hook in mautrix-jabber to forward `call.member`/decline
      events to the core.
- [x] **J5 dedupe:** when calls are enabled, skip mautrix-jabber's XEP-0353 JMI "Incoming/Missed call"
      notices for calls the core is handling (or for all Cheogram numbers), so they aren't doubled.
- [x] **J6 build:** add libopus to mautrix-jabber's Dockerfile. Check that the binary still builds
      without calls enabled at runtime. Optionally add a `nocalls` build tag to drop the dependency.
- [x] **J7 docs:** README for both repos. Warn against running the standalone bridge and the embedded
      mode on the same SIP account.
- [x] **J8 telemetry (TELEMETRY-SPEC §8.2):** jabber calls `obs.Use` with its providers; jabber's
      `pkg/telemetry` gains metrics (port T6b back) and its span/log helpers delegate to `pkg/obs`
      (log-annotation convergence, spec §3.2); an embedded test asserts core spans carry jabber's
      resource `service.name` and nest under a jabber-created span passed in ctx; jabber README documents
      the new `mrtcsip.*` metrics and that setting `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` now also enables metrics
      (`OTEL_METRICS_EXPORTER=none` to keep the old behaviour). Call `obs.Use` before `SIPConnector.Start`:
      `Use` rebuilds the instruments, which drops the registrations gauge callback registered earlier.

Things to sort out before J3 (record answers in an ADR):
- Cheogram portals for group MMS (comma-separated numbers) never get calls. Calls map only to 1:1
  portals.
- mautrix-jabber portals must be unencrypted for calls to work. Document it, and warn at runtime.

### Phase 4 — Robustness

- [ ] Persist call state. On restart, mark stale calls ended and clear leftover ghost memberships.
- [ ] Re-REGISTER on network change, SIP session timers / re-INVITE, membership refresh on long calls.
- [ ] Multiple SIP accounts per Matrix user. Concurrent calls. Hold/call waiting.
- [ ] **Telemetry (TELEMETRY-SPEC §8.2):** `call.membership.refresh`, `call.reinvite`,
      `sip.registrar.switch` on network change; restart cleanup emits one `bridge.cleanup_stale_calls`
      root with counts; concurrent-call tests assert spans of different calls never share a trace.

### Phase 5 — Polish

- OpenTelemetry tracing, metrics and log correlation moved out of Phase 5: see
  `docs/TELEMETRY-SPEC.md`. Foundation is task T6 in Phase 1, and instrumentation is part of the
  definition of done of Phases 2, 3, 4 and J (setup latency, RTP loss and jitter are metrics there).

### Phase 6 — Optional: bridge-issued credentials for ancillary SIP phones (ADR-007)

Not a blocker, nice-to-have.

- [ ] Built-in registrar: generate per-device SIP credentials (bot command), accept REGISTER from LAN
      devices.
- [ ] Fork inbound calls to registered devices alongside Matrix clients. First answer wins, others get
      CANCEL / ring stopped.
- [ ] Outbound from the device through the bridge's upstream registration (B2BUA, separate dialogs,
      RTP relay).

### Future / unscheduled

- **Dialer UX for new numbers (ADR-008).** Progress: the dialpad widget (option 1, `docs/WIDGET-SPEC.md`)
  is code complete for the standalone host on branch `widget-dialpad` (W1-W5: calls snapshot, hostkit
  actions and config, `pkg/widget`, UI, standalone wiring); jabber wiring (W6) and the live test (W7) are
  open. The Dialpad PWA (`docs/PWA-SPEC.md`, ADR-013) is code complete for the standalone host on the
  same branch (P1-P5: device store, hostkit commands, server API, front end, standalone wiring and docs);
  jabber wiring (P6) and the live test (P7) are open. Most clients have no dialpad. Baseline: bot command /
  DM-the-ghost (Phase 3). Cheap experiment: PSTN third-party protocol lookup (Element Web dialpad).
  Later: dialpad widget. Long term: an Android helper app with a Telecom `ConnectionService` /
  `PhoneAccount` (Cheogram-style native dialer integration), or a dialer added to existing/forked
  clients.
- G.722 / Opus over SIP if the provider offers them. Video is out of scope unless needed.

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| NAT / RTP reachability | External IP + port range config, symmetric RTP, keepalives. Validate in S2. |
| MatrixRTC unstable event types change | One file of constants citing the MSC and the Element Call version checked. |
| Encrypted rooms → silent calls | Create unencrypted rooms. Detect encryption and post a notice instead. |
| mautrix version skew between hosts (Phase J) | Keep the core's mautrix surface tiny. Bump both repos together. |
| Two hosts registering one SIP account | Documented. Optionally detect via registrar contact list. |
| JMP SIP minute caps (unverified) | Document. Out of our control. |
| Audio quality / jitter | Simple jitter buffer first. Measure. Fall back per ADR-003. |
| lk-jwt-service room-name mismatch | Always fetch tokens via the auth service as the ghost. |

## Testing strategy

- Unit: SDP offer/answer, phone normalisation, call state machine (fake SIP + fake RTC + fake
  CallHost), MatrixRTC event fixtures.
- Integration: `sipp` or local Asterisk as a fake provider plus local Synapse + LiveKit +
  lk-jwt-service in docker-compose.
- Manual: real JMP account, Element X on a phone, Element Web.
